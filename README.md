# FMOD-Extentions
A tool I wrote in late 2017, and finalised in early 2018, that allows for a better integration between FMOD's low level engine and Unity.

Iterations have been made past this version but not to a significant extent. Mainly, the changes involved UI and not the underlying code.

Having not been updated -or reviewed-, there are mistakes in the code and optimisations that could have been made. However, I would like this release to show my understanding of FMOD concepts -and programming concepts in general- but still show where I need to improve.
